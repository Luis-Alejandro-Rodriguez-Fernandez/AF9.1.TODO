      <p>
        Madrid is the capital of Spain with elegant boulevards and large parks
        very well cared for, such as the Buen Retiro. It is famous for its
        rich collections of European and Spanish art in the Prado Museum. The
        heart of the old Habsburg Madrid is the Plaza Mayor lined with
        porticoes and close by is the Royal Palace and the Armory, which
        exhibit historic arsenals.

        London is the capital and largest city of England and the United

        the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea,
        London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was
        founded by the Romans.
